# Individual Capstone Assesment



###Senior Design Project

The senior design project, from an academic perspective, is all about implementing the skills learned in and outside of the classroom. This full-stack web development project will give me an opportunity to better understand user requirements and in turn reciprocate it in the form of a highly user-friendly and adaptable User Interface. In addition, this project will also allow me to use some valuable knowledge that I have gained from some classes like Introduction to Cloud Computing and Software engineering to make the web application robust, dependable and portable. This project is not only a great addition to my resume but also a great opportunity to upskill myself.

In one way or the other, almost all classes, specific to my major, are going to prove to be beneficial at one stage or the other of this web development project. Classes like Computer Science I (CS1021C), Data Structures (CS2028), Programming Languages (CS4003), Software Engineering (EECE3093C), Intro to Cloud Computing (CS5165) have really helped me develop some technical knowledge and skills which are going to help me lay a solid foundation for the project. Classes like Discrete Computational Structures (CS2071) and Design and Analysis of Algorithms (CS4071) have assisted me in further strengthening my problem-solving skills which I will greatly benefit from in the implementation phase of this project.

My co-op experience as a whole is going to play a major role in the success of this project. As an application developer and tester at Honeywell, the vital full-stack development skills that I learned are going be the main driver for this project. The DevOps skills that I gained from my time at Accenture - CBTS are going to help to make this application lightweight, portable and robust.

My motivation for this project stems from the visualization of the envisaged final product. Iâ€™m excited about this project because of the process and how stimulating it is in terms of though-process and out of the box thinking. Apart from the fact that I love technology and coding, I absolutely enjoy the process it offers. The process of trial and error and problem-solving is the source of motivation and excitement.

My pre-liminary approach consists of outlining a broad, step-by-step, plan of attack. From there, its about assigning the tasks and specifying a variable deadline for them. My expected result is a highly satisfied user who finds every aspect of the application easy to adapt to and useful. I will evaluate my contributions based on the goal I set for myself at the start of the project. Another parameter for self-evaluation will be the satisfaction of my peer(s) and advisor(s) which will also govern the quality and completeness of my work.
